# Microcharts GTK Samples

[Microcharts](https://github.com/aloisdeniel/Microcharts) is an extremely simple charting library for a wide range of platforms (see Compatibility section below), with shared code and rendering for all of them!. Created by [Alo√Øs Deniel](https://github.com/aloisdeniel) and using SkiaSharp.

In this repository we created a small sample to test Microcharts with Xamarin.Forms **GTK** backend (**Linux**).
